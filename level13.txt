<- ./level13
-> UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

He want us to be 4242, we will be 4242:

<- gdb level13
<- disas main

Some getuid but the first one is followed with a cmp, we'll change the value of the compared register:

<- br *main+14
<- r
<- i r
-> eax            0x7dd    2013

We'll change eax value for 4242:

<- set $eax=4242
<- c
-> your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
