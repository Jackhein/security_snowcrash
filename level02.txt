<- ls -l
-> level02.pcap

pcap file are readable with wireshark.
These type of file are created with Wireshark as result of network analysis.

We'll open this file with it:

On local terminal :
<- scp -P 4242 level02@192.168.147.3:level02.pcap level02.pcap

We got localy level02.pcap.

Now we read it witch wireshark (if not already installed install it (I'm using windows, on mac it might differ for wireshark use)).

When reading the level02.pcap with woreshark, we car find "Password:" in packet 43.
Here we took the following data and follow the tcp stream (on windows : right clic -> follow -> tcp stream).

Here we see :
-> ..wwwbugs login: l.le.ev.ve.el.lX.X
-> ..
-> Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

The password "ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L" seems a bit odd with the three dot.
We'll check the hex value
-> 66 74 5f 77 61 6e 64 72 7f 7f 7f 4e 44 52 65 6c 7f 4c 30 4c 0d

The value of 7f in ascii is DEL. So let's try withouth the dots and the character wrote previously:
ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L -> ft_waNDReL0L

<- su flag02
<- ft_waNDReL0L
-> Don't forget to launch getflag !
<- getflag
-> Check flag.Here is your token : kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq
