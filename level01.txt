We can see that we can read /etc/passwd:
(Only differance can be detected at flag01).
<- cat /et/passwd | grep flag01
-> flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

Like before, it's not a clear password.

We can use jhon the ripper to search for it,
It gave us abcdefg :

<- su flag01
<- Password:abcdefg
-> Don't forget to launch getflag !
<- getflag
-> Check flag.Here is your token : f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf
